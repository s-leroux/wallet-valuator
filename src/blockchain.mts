/**
 * Class Blockchain
 *
 * Represents a blockchain identifier, **not** a full conceptual model of a blockchain.
 *
 * This class is designed primarily as a **unique identifier** for different blockchains.
 * It is **not** intended to encapsulate blockchain-specific logic, transaction handling,
 * or native currency management. Instead, it serves as a lightweight, registry-backed
 * key that can be used for lookups, comparisons, and mappings.
 *
 * ## Key Characteristics:
 * - **Immutable & Lightweight:** A `Blockchain` instance only holds a string name.
 * - **Singleton-like Behavior:** Instances are cached and retrieved via `Blockchain.create(name)`.
 * - **Ensures Consistency:** Prevents duplicate instances for the same blockchain name.
 * - **Optimized for Lookups:** Can be used as a key in `Map<Blockchain, ...>`.
 *
 * ## Important Notes:
 * - The native currency of a blockchain is **not** stored in this class. Instead, `Explorer`
 *   or other components should manage blockchain-specific details.
 * - `Blockchain` should be treated as a **reference** or **label**, similar to an enum value.
