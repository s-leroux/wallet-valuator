## Overview

Wallet Valuator is a TypeScript project that handles cryptocurrency accounting
and portfolio valuation.  It includes both a reusable library and a command-line
interface.

Wallet Valuator began as a small TypeScript library to explore onâ€‘chain data.
The original goal was to let developers navigate the blockchain in code as
easily as they would through a block explorer such as GnosisScan. Only the
`Address` and `Transaction` classes were implemented at that time.

The project pivoted when it became necessary to prepare a French tax declaration
for multiple wallets.  Accounting requirements forced several design changes:

- navigation features became secondary to the ability to aggregate transactions
  across chains and centralized exchanges (CEXs)
- tokens stored on different blockchains now map to logical **crypto assets** so
  that a single asset (for example USDC) can be reported regardless of the
  chain it resides on
- the library gained a commandâ€‘line entry point at `cli/blockchain-cli.mts` for
  processing wallets and generating reports

Today Wallet Valuator is both a library and a CLI application focused on
cryptoâ€‘asset tracking and accounting for French regulations.  The interactive
navigation layer still exists, but accounting is the main focus.
